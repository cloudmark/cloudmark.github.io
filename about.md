Hi there! I'm Mark, a passionate software engineer based in the beautiful island of Malta. I thrive on solving puzzles and tackling programming problems, always on the lookout for innovative solutions and cutting-edge technologies.

When I'm not immersed in the world of tech, I'm a dedicated dad to two adorable kids who keep me on my toes and remind me of the simple joys in life. Beyond the digital realm, I find great satisfaction in woodworking, transforming pieces of wood into functional art with my own hands.

My professional interests are as diverse as my personal ones. I have a deep love for Functional Programming, particularly type-level programming, which allows me to write more robust and expressive code. I'm also an avid fan of Reactive Programming, enjoying the elegance and efficiency it brings to managing asynchronous data streams.

This site is my personal repository, a space where I share my ideas, ongoing projects, and anything else that sparks my curiosity. Whether you're a fellow tech enthusiast, a woodworking aficionado, or just someone passing by, I hope you find something here that piques your interest.

Feel free to contact me at [mmgalea@gmail.com](mailto:email@domain.com)
