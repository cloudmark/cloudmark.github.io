<img class="title" src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/akka/akka.png"/> The original definition of Actors by Hewitt, Bishop and Steiger stated that i) everything is an actor ii) actors have their own memory and iii) actors communicate by sending and receiving messages _asynchronously_.  When responding to messages an actor can i) send a finite number of messages ii) create a finite number of actors, and iii) designate new behaviour.  Designating behaviour in Akka is done through the `become` and `unbecome` primitives.  Although these primitives are adequate for systems with a small number of states, state management in large systems requires a higher level of abstraction.  One of the abstractions used to control states is the [Akka FSM Mixin](http://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/current/scala/fsm.html). In this post we will describe how to use the Akka FSM Mixin through a classic Akka example - the Wire Transfer example.  We will also extend this example to show how one can implement At Most Once semantics.    


#  Introduction
The ability to designate behaviour is one of the corner stones of Actor systems.  Without the ability to designate behaviour Actor systems would be unable to manage state without resorting to mutability.  Typically, behaviour is designated in Akka through `become` and `unbecome`.  Although `become` and `unbecome` are adequate, in general it is desired to design Actor systems on a higher level of abstraction.  One of the abstraction tools provided by Akka is the Akka FSM mixin.  Before we dive into FSM in detail we will first go through a classic Akka example - the Wire Transfer -  and work this out from first principles.   The Wire Transfer example, as the name implies, refers to the problem of transferring money from one bank account to another.  

First stop in this transaction adventure is Bank Account ville! 

## Bank Account 
A `BankAccount` actor can receive two types of messages: `Deposit` and `Withdraw`. Success and Failure business acknowledgements will be indicated by the `Done` and `Failed` messages respectively.  These messages will be defined in the `BankAccount` companion object.  


```scala 
object BankAccount {

  case class Deposit(amount: BigInt) {
    require(amount > 0)
  }

  case class Withdraw(amount: BigInt) {
    require(amount > 0)
  }

  case object Done
  case object Failed
}
```

The implementation of the Bank Account actor is the following: 

```scala
class BankAccount extends Actor {
  var balance = BigInt(0)

  def receive = LoggingReceive {
    case Deposit(amount) =>
      balance += amount
      sender ! Done

    case Withdraw(amount) if amount <= balance =>
      balance -= amount
      sender ! Done

    case _ => sender ! Failed
  }
}
```

 When a client sends a `Deposit` message the `BankAccount` actor will add the deposited `amount` to the `balance`.  When a client sends a `Withdraw` message the `BankAccount` actor will check whether there is sufficient `balance` in the account and if this precondition is met, the balance is decremented and a `Done` reply is sent to the client.  If the precondition fails a `Failed` message is sent to the client.  

# Wire Transfer 
In order to handle transfers between two `BankAccount`s we will delegate this responsibility to the `Wire Transfer` actor .  A `WireTransfer` actor can understand primarily one message - `Transfer` - which initiates a transfer of `amount` money from a `from: ActorRef` to a `to: ActorRef`.  We will define this message in the `WireTransfer` companion object together with the `Done` and `Failed` business acknowledgments. 


```scala
object WireTransfer {
  case class Transfer(from: ActorRef, to: ActorRef, amount: BigInt)

  case object Done

  case object Failed
}
```

The implementation of the `WireTransfer` is made up of three states: 

1. *Initial State*: In this _Initial_ state the `WireTransfer` actor can receive a `Transfer` message which will initiate the `transfer`.  When a transfer is initiated a `Withdraw` message is sent to the `from` ActorRef and the behaviour is designated to _Awaiting From_ state.
2. *Awaiting From State*: In this state the Wire Transfer actor has sent a `Withdraw` message and is awaiting a business acknowledgement from the `from` ActorRef.  If the `from` ActorRef replies with `Done` then the `Withdraw` has been performed (by the `from` ActorRef)  and the `WireTransfer` proceeds by sending a `Deposit` message to the `to` ActorRef.  The `WireTransfer` actor will designate the behaviour to _Await To_ state.  
3. *Await To State*: In this State the Wire Transfer actor has sent the `Deposit` message to the `to` ActorRef and is now expecting a reply.  If the `to` ActorRef replies with `Done`, the `WireTransfer` actor sends a `Done` business acknowledgement to the original client and terminates.  If the `to` ActorRef receives a `Failed` message the `WireTransfer` actor will send a `Failed` business acknowledgement to the original client and terminates.  

This simple state machine can be represented diagrammatically as follows: 

<img class="step minimal" style="width: 50%"  src="{{ site.baseurl }}/images/akka/FSM.png"/>


Using the `become` primitive the WireTransfer state machine can be implemented as follows: 

```scala
class WireTransfer extends Actor {
  def receive: Receive = LoggingReceive {
    case Transfer(from, to, amount) =>
      from ! BankAccount.Withdraw(amount)
      context.become(awaitFrom(to, amount, sender))
  }

  def awaitFrom(to: ActorRef, amount: BigInt, customer: ActorRef): Receive = LoggingReceive {
    case BankAccount.Done =>
      to ! BankAccount.Deposit(amount)
      context.become(awaitTo(customer))
    case BankAccount.Failed =>
      customer ! Failed
      context.stop(self)
  }

  def awaitTo(customer: ActorRef): Receive = LoggingReceive {
    case BankAccount.Done =>
      customer ! Done
      context.stop(self)
  }
}
```
Note that in this case we do not make use of the `unbecome` primitive.  In reality the `unbecome` primitive is rarely used.   


## Wire Transfer using FSM
The main problem with the above implementation is that things are not explicit.  Although we move from one state to another given an event, the new state and the changes to the data are not explicit.  Ideally the problem should be modeled as a set of relations of the form:

$$
State\(S\) \times Event\(E\) \implies Actions\(A\), State\(Sâ€™\)
$$

which informally means that if we are in state \\(State\(S\)\\) and an \\(Event\(E\)\\) occurs then actions \\(Actions(A)\\) should be performed and the system should transition to \\(State\(S'\)\\).  


A state in FSM is defined as the current position on the state machine together with any data.  In the Wire Transfer example above the user may be in either one of these states (we will talk about the data part shortly!): `Initial`, `AwaitFrom`, `AwaitTo` or `Done`.  These states (positions) can be expressed in Scala as follows: 

```scala
sealed trait State
object Initial extends State
object AwaitFrom extends State
object AwaitTo extends State
object Done extends State
```

The data required by a `WireTransfer` actor are the `from`, `to` and `amount` data contained in the initial `Transfer` message.  Additionally the original `sender` which should receive the business acknowledgement should be stored.  We will package this data in the `InitialisedWireTransferData` object.  Initially, prior to receiving the `Transfer` message, the `from`, `to`, `amount` and `sender` will be undefined.  We will represent this using the `UninitializedWireTransferData` object as follows: 

```scala
sealed trait Data
case object UninitializedWireTransferData extends Data
case class InitialisedWireTransferData(from: ActorRef, to: ActorRef, amount: BigInt, client: ActorRef) extends Data
```

Now that we have the state and data defined, we can implement the `WireTransfer` FSM as follows: 


```scala
class WireTransfer extends FSM[State, Data] {
  
  startWith(Initial, UninitializedWireTransferData)
  
  when(Initial) {
    case Event(Transfer(from, to, amount), UninitializedWireTransferData) =>
      from ! BankAccount.Withdraw(amount)
      goto(AwaitFrom) using InitialisedWireTransferData(from, to, amount, sender())
  }

  when(AwaitFrom) {
    case Event(BankAccount.Done, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, to, amount, _)) =>
      to ! BankAccount.Deposit(amount)
      goto(AwaitTo)
    case Event(BankAccount.Failed, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Failed
      goto(Done)
      stop()
  }

  when(AwaitTo) {
    case Event(BankAccount.Done, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Done
      goto(Done)
      stop()
    case Event(BankAccount.Failed, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Failed
      goto(Done)
      stop()
  }
  
  initialize()
}
```

The code is pretty self explanatory.  The state machine will start in the `Initial` state with all values uninitialised (represented by the `UninitializedWireTransferData`).  The only type of message which can be received in the `Initial` state is the initial `Transfer` request at which point a `Withdraw` message is sent to the `from` ActorRef and the state machine transitions to the `AwaitFrom` state.  

When the system is in the `AwaitFrom` state the only two messages that can be received are `Done` or `Failure` from the `from` ActorRef.  If the `Done` business acknowledgement is received the system will send a `Deposit` message to the `to` ActorRef and transition to the `AwaitTo` state.  The system will `stop()` if a `Failure`  is received. 
 
 When the system is in the `AwaitTo` state the only two messages that can be received are the `Done` or `Failure` from the `to` ActorRef.  If the `Done` business acknowledgement is received the system will send a `Done` business acknowledgement to the original `sender`. Else if a `Failure` is received, it sends the sender a `Failure` business acknowledgement.  

# At Most Once Semantics
When dealing with transactions in the above example we have assumed that messages (originating from the `from` and `to` actors) are unique and hence should always be processed.  In general, this assumption is wrong.  In order to guarantee that a message is received by an actor we need to be able to send a message more than once (and at least once).  When multiple identical messages can be sent to an actor, the actor needs to determine whether the received message is to be processed  (unless a pure function is implemented).  We can generify this concept by creating our own custom `AtMostOnceFSM` as follows: 


```scala
class AtMostOnceFSM[S, D] extends FSM[S, D] {

  protected[this] def hasBeenProcessed(message: S): Boolean = {
    false
  }

  def AtMostOnce(stateFunction: StateFunction): StateFunction = new StateFunction() {
    override def isDefinedAt(msg: Event): Boolean = stateFunction.isDefinedAt(msg)

    override def apply(msg: Event): State = msg match {
      case msg@Event(s: S, _) =>
        if (!hasBeenProcessed(s)) {
          stateFunction(msg)
        } else {
          stay()
        }
      case msg@_ => stateFunction(msg)
    }
  }
}
```

The `AtMostOnceFSM` contains a function `AtMostOnce` which wraps up an original `StateFunction`.  The `AtMostOnce` state function will first determine whether the received message is defined on the original function (`isDefinedAt`) and if defined, it will perform the _at most once check_ by delegating to the `hasBeenProcessed` function.  In the `WireTransfer` example we will use the default implementation which will assume that a message has not yet been processed. Using this custom FSM we can update the original `WireTransfer` actor as follows: 

```scala
class WireTransfer extends AtMostOnceFSM[State, Data] {
  startWith(Initial, UninitializedWireTransferData)
  when(Initial) (AtMostOnce {
    case Event(Transfer(from, to, amount), UninitializedWireTransferData) =>
      from ! BankAccount.Withdraw(amount)
      goto(AwaitFrom) using InitialisedWireTransferData(from, to, amount, sender())
  })

  when(AwaitFrom) (AtMostOnce {
    case Event(BankAccount.Done, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, to, amount, _)) =>
      to ! BankAccount.Deposit(amount)
      goto(AwaitTo)
    case Event(BankAccount.Failed, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Failed
      goto(Done)
      stop()
  })

  when(AwaitTo) (AtMostOnce {
    case Event(BankAccount.Done, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Done
      goto(Done)
      stop()
    case Event(BankAccount.Failed, InitialisedWireTransferData(_, _, _, client)) =>
      client ! WireTransfer.Failed
      goto(Done)
      stop()
  })
  initialize()
}
```

The real implementation of the `hasBeenProcessed` will require unique identifier for `BankAccount`s and for each `WireTransfer`.  This is left as an exercise to the reader.  


_The observant reader might have noticed that the `isDefinedAt` function uses the `stateFunction` rather than the list of messages received by the proxy in the `apply` function.  This is deliberate since we only want to proxy any messages which were defined in the original function and ignore anything else._

# Conclusion
Some have defined `become` and `unbecome` as the 'evil' Actor counterpart of Imperative `goto`s.  In large systems (with lots of states), using `become` and `unbecome` directly can lead to a spaghetti code of states.  In this post we have shown how we can use the Actor FSM Mixin to implement Finite State Machines which abstract away `become` and `unbecome` calls and make states (and data) more explicit.  Stay safe and keep hacking!
